\begin{quoting}
  This assignment centers around a data set very similar to the one
  used in the DAPSm paper by \cite{papadogeorgou2018adjusting}. The
  data contain information on power plants operating in the United
  States in 2002 and 2014, and are available on the Canvas site in the
  file annualEGUs.csv. Specifically, the units in the data are
  Electricity Generating Units (EGUs) in 2002 and 2014, some of which
  were treated with a particular technology to reduce their emissions
  of $\text{NO}_x$, an important precursor to harmful air
  pollution. The technology is a Selective Catalytic Reduction or
  Selective Non Catalytic Reduction System, (SnCR). The outcome of
  interest is the level of $\text{NO}_x$ emissions. Several other
  characteristics are measured on each power plant. Table 1 lists the
  variables that you will use for this analysis (you can ignore any
  other variables you see in the data). For all analyses of these
  data, log transform the \texttt{Outcome} variable.

\section{Exercise 1}

\begin{quoting}
  Separately for 2002 and 2014, conduct an unadjusted “crude” analysis
  comparing the average NOx levels for treated and untreated
  units. Evaluate whether the observed covariates are balanced in this
  unadjusted analysis.
