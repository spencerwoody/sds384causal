\begin{quoting}
  This assignment centers around a data set very similar to the one
  used in the DAPSm paper by \cite{papadogeorgou2018adjusting}. The
  data contain information on power plants operating in the United
  States in 2002 and 2014, and are available on the Canvas site in the
  file \texttt{annualEGUs.csv}. Specifically, the units in the data
  are Electricity Generating Units (EGUs) in 2002 and 2014, some of
  which were treated with a particular technology to reduce their
  emissions of $\text{NO}_x$, an important precursor to harmful air
  pollution. The technology is a Selective Catalytic Reduction or
  Selective Non Catalytic Reduction System, (SnCR). The outcome of
  interest is the level of $\text{NO}_x$ emissions. Several other
  characteristics are measured on each power
  plant. Table~\ref{tab:data-description} lists the variables that you
  will use for this analysis (you can ignore any other variables you
  see in the data). For all analyses of these data, log transform the
  \texttt{Outcome} variable.

\section{Exercise 1}

\begin{quoting}
  Separately for 2002 and 2014, conduct an unadjusted ``crude'' analysis
  comparing the average NOx levels for treated and untreated
  units. Evaluate whether the observed covariates are balanced in this
  unadjusted analysis.
\end{quoting}

Here are throughout this assignment, we assume a linear model of the
form
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:lin-mod}
  \log y_i = \beta_0 + \alpha z_i + x_i^\intercal \beta + \varepsilon_i,
  \quad \varepsilon_i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)
\end{align}
where $y_i$ is the annual emissions of NO$_x$ for the $i$th power
plant, $z_i$ is the treatment indicator, and $x_i$ is a vector of the
other covariates listed in Table~\ref{tab:data-description}.  The
parameter $\alpha$ is the treatment effect.

In the crude analysis we use the entire dataset for years 2002 and
2014, respectively, to estimate the parameters in
Eq.~\eqref{eq:lin-mod}.  Full regression estimates from this crude
analysis are given in Tables~\ref{tab:crude-lm-02} and
\ref{tab:crude-lm-14} at the end of the document.  The treatment
effect estimates from both years are:
\begin{itemize}
\item 2002: -0.9525 (SE = $0.0669$, $p < 0.0001$)
\item 2014: -0.7069 (SE = $0.0450$, $p < 0.0001$)
\end{itemize}
Here are throughout, we use the ordinary least squares estimate of the
standard error, which is the outcome of the \texttt{lm} command in R.  

We see that the causal effect of SnCR installations on annual NO$_x$
emissions is significant and negative for both years, with the effect
larger in magnitude for year 2002 than for year 2014. 

Tables \ref{tab-bal1-02} and \ref{tab-bal1-14} present summaries of
covariate balance between the treatment and control groups, using
various (unpaired) tests of null hypothesis of no difference in mean
of the covariate between the groups.  We use the t-test, z-test, or
chi-squared test depending on the data type.  There is significant
imbalance present in the dataset from both years.  A large portion of
the tests return very small p-values, a manifestation of significant
differences in the distribution of covariates between treated and
control units. This problem is especially bad for year 2014.
Therefore, we should be cautious to characterize these figures as
consistent estimates of the causal effect of interest since there
could be confounding which has not been accounted for.
