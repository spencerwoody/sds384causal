abstract = {Summary Continuous treatments (e.g. doses) arise often in
                  practice, but many available causal effect
                  estimators are limited by either requiring
                  parametric models for the effect curve, or by not
                  allowing doubly robust covariate adjustment. We
                  develop a novel kernel smoothing approach that
                  requires only mild smoothness assumptions on the
                  effect curve and still allows for misspecification
                  of either the treatment density or outcome
                  regression. We derive asymptotic properties and give
                  a procedure for data-driven bandwidth selection. The
                  methods are illustrated via simulation and in a
                  study of the effect of nurse staffing on hospital
                  readmissions penalties.},

 abstract = {Estimation of average treatment effects in observational studies often requires adjustment for differences in pre-treatment variables. If the number of pre-treatment variables is large, standard covariance adjustment methods are often inadequate. Rosenbaum \& Rubin (1983) propose an alternative method for adjusting for pre-treatment variables for the binary treatment case based on the so-called propensity score. Here an extension of the propensity score methodology is proposed that allows for estimation of average casual effects with multi-valued treatments.},

    abstract = { In a longitudinal study of dose–response, it is often necessary to adjust for confounding or non-compliance, which may otherwise compromise the estimation of the true effect of a treatment. Using an approach based on the generalised propensity score (GPS) – a generalisation of the classical, binary treatment propensity score – it is possible to construct a balancing score that provides an estimation procedure for the true (unconfounded) direct effect of dose on response. Previously, the GPS has been applied only in a single interval setting; in this article, we extend the GPS methodology to the longitudinal setting to estimate the direct effect of a continuous dose on a longitudinal response. The methodology is applied to two simulated examples, and a real longitudinal dose–response investigation, the Monitored Occlusion Treatment of Amblyopia Study (MOTAS). In the treatment of childhood amblyopia, a common ophthalmological condition, occlusion therapy (patching) was for many decades the standard medical treatment, despite the fact that its efficacy was not quantified. MOTAS was revolutionary, as it was the first study to obtain precise measurements of the amount of occlusion each study participant received over the course of the study. }
